# Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of emails into spam and legitimate categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It aims to develop an efficient spam email classification system that can significantly enhance email security and improve user experience by accurately distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

## Problem Statement

Spam emails present a considerable challenge to both individuals and organizations. These unsolicited messages clutter inboxes, waste time, and expose users to security threats such as phishing, malware, and identity theft. Traditional rule-based spam filters are becoming less effective due to the evolving strategies of spammers. Thus, there is a pressing need for more advanced spam detection systems that can dynamically adapt to new spam patterns and offer high accuracy.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and preprocess a dataset of spam and legitimate emails for model training.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract meaningful features from email content using NLP techniques such as TF-IDF.
3. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate several machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) for spam email classification.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Implementation**: Develop a prototype system for real-time spam email classification.

## Methodology

1. **Dataset**: The project uses publicly available email datasets, including the SpamAssassin Public Corpus and the Enron Email Dataset, which contain labeled emails.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The email text undergoes cleaning (removal of HTML tags, special characters, stopwords), stemming, and lemmatization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Textual data is converted into numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which helps in capturing important features of the email text.
4. **Model Training**: Machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest are trained on the extracted features to classify emails as spam or legitimate.
5. **Evaluation**: The performance of each model is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are applied to handle class imbalance in the dataset.

## Key Results

The SVM classifier outperforms other models, achieving an accuracy of 98%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of SVM in spam email classification, as it maintains a balance between precision and recall. The high performance of the SVM model ensures minimal false positives and false negatives, making it a reliable choice for real-time spam detection.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of combining NLP and ML techniques to create an efficient spam email classification system. The integration of advanced algorithms like SVM ensures accurate identification of spam emails, reducing the risks associated with phishing and other malicious activities. Future work can explore incorporating deep learning models and real-time classification systems for further enhancement.

## Requirements

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
